Create or open an existing project and press on the 'AssetLib' tab found at the top of the editor. Once the asset library has loaded, search for  '*Model_DiagramGen*'. The top result should be this plugin, press on it and you'll be given the option to download it. Press to download and once it's completed Godot will ask you to select what you'd like to install. If you only want the plugin then only select the `addons` folder.

## Clone / Download
If for whatever reason you don't want to or can't download plugin via the in-engine Godot asset library, then you can always clone or download this repository directly. Once you've cloned or downloaded this repository, you can import it directly into Godot as a project to view the various examples and edit them directly. You may as well move the plugin's folder directly into your own projectâ€™s `addons` folder.
